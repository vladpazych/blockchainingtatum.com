<!-- # About author
I am Vlad Pazych, living in Kyiv, Ukraine. I started programming when I was 16. Hired to work on a crypto project at 22. After another 4 years of software development, I just got bored to death solving the same problems over and over. 

ðŸ™Œ Now I am 26, an aspiring educational content creator, and your host at Blockchaining Tatum!
